# foodPicker
setup.sh: (bash)
 -Creates c++ program with correct file names compiled as Picker
 -Optional: Adds alias to .bash_aliases or .bash_profile if it finds them in ~ directory
restaurants.txt:
 -List of restaurants to eat at
 -Seperated into diffent options i.e brekfast, seperator value is '~'
main.cpp: (C++11 and above)
 -Takes option value for type what type of random place you want to eat
  -b: brekfast places
  -f: Fast food places
  -s: Sit down places
  -n: Nice places
  -d: Drink places
  -F: Fry places
  -p: Print all places from selected options
  -a: All true but -p(unless specified) 
 -Reads certain parts of file based on options
 -Outputs random restuarant from each selected option

Starting:
 Option 1:
  -run './setup.sh'
  -Answer prompts if you have .bash_alias or .bash_profile
    -If you add alias dont forget to source the file!
  -run new alias like "ALIAS -h'
   -this outputs help screen
 Option 2:
  -if you want to be able to create well working alias add path route inside main.cpp
  -compile main.cpp
  -use new program in alias file
 Option 3:
  -Run the program given
  -Create alias that cds into program directory then uses program then cd - back
  
Editing:
 -If you edit main.cpp then setup.sh most likely will not work as it is set up to change a specific line(105) to make personalized program
 -If you want to add more options ie(type of restraunts):
  -Add new section to restuarants.txt with proper formatting '~'!
  -Add bool values to Args struct
  -Go to getoptions function
   -Add more options into the string
   -add more case statements
  -Go to addv function:
   -add more case statements to represent which part of file we are in
  -If you want setup.sh to still work change find where the string file is declared in main.cpp
   -In sh find line where it is comparing line number to 105 change to new value of string file in main.cpp
